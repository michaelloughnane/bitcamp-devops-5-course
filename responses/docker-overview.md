## Hello world with Docker üê≥

@{{user.login}} we are going to start with the typical "Hello World" example and build something more complex after, but first let's decide if a Docker based action is the right action for us!

#### Why use Docker when writing GitHub Actions?

That's a super great question to ask. Before we talk about the components that make up Docker based actions, we should understand the good and the bad of Docker based actions.

| Docker actions package the source code that will be executed right alongside any dependencies that source code has.                                                                                                         | Slower execution time because the image containing your source code and dependencies gets built with every workflow run. |
| Docker containers package the environment with the GitHub Actions code. This creates a more consistent and reliable unit of work because the consumer of the action does not need to worry about the tools or dependencies. | Docker container actions can only execute in the GitHub-hosted Linux environment.                                        |
| Ideal for running in environments with very specific configurations and tools.                                                                                                                                              | Debugging can be difficult with containers.                                                                              |
| Actions can be written in any language you choose.                                                                                                                                                                          | More files to maintain when changes to the action occur.                                                                 |

#### Got it, what now?

Let's begin by exploring the components of a Docker based action and discuss how they fit together!
