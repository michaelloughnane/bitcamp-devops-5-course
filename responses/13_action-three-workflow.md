## Action three

Two actions down, one more to go! Before we move on with building our final action let's take a second to do a quick recap since this lesson has thrown a lot of information at you.

**The workflow**
We started out by explaining what a workflow is and how it pertains to the GitHub Actions platform. You learned about how a defined event sets your workflow orchestra in motion.

You learned about runners, jobs, steps and have dabbled in the syntax of a workflow file at every step in this course. I don't want to spoil too much here, but you'll be doing it again in this one as well ðŸ˜‰.

**Action metadata**
You learned that every action is accompanied by an `action.yml` file which contains a series of metadata for how the action behaves. This file defines all of an actions inputs, outputs, runtime environment, name, description and even branding.

**Hello action**
Your first Docker action took the traditional path of a "Hello World" introduction. You ended up expanding that action to accept `inputs` to help make it a little more dynamic. Ultimately, the key takeaway was to understand that you can pass input that is defined in the workflow to an action as long as the action's metadata supports it.

When consuming or creating actions it is incredibly helpful to take care to understand that actions metadata file.

**Cat fact action**
You second Docker action demonstrated that your workflow environment is capable of communicating outside of it's own network. We reached out to an external API and used that information to set `outputs` for another action to consume. As with `inputs` your actions metadata must support the ability to set `outputs` if you want to use this option.

**What next?**
Your third, and final, Docker action of this course is going to do quite a bit to tie everything together. Let's take a look at what we will build:

- Although we can write actions directly in JavaScript, we can also create Docker actions using JavaScript as the language of choice. Our third action will be containerized JavaScript.
- Since it is JavaScript we can use the [Actions ToolKit](https://github.com/actions/toolkit).
- It is also going to consume the `outputs` of your cat action and use them to help create issues in your repository.

## Reference the issue-maker action

We need to make some edits to the `my-workflow.yml` file to get it configured to use this final action.

### :keyboard: Activity: Reference issue-maker in the `my-workflow.yml`

1. [Edit]({{workflowFile}}) your `.github/workflows/my-workflow.yml` file to contain the following contents:

   ```yaml
   name: Docker Actions

   on:
     pull_request:
       types: [labeled]

   jobs:
     action:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest

       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v1

         - name: hello-action
           uses: ./.github/actions/hello-world

         - name: meow
           uses: ./.github/actions/cat-facts
           id: cat

         - name: create-issue
           uses: ./.github/actions/issue-maker
           with:
             repoToken: {% raw %}${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}{% endraw %}
             catFact: {% raw %}${{steps.cat.outputs.fact}}{% endraw %}
             issueTitle: "a cat fact for you"
   ```

1. Commit the changes to a new branch and name it `action-three`.
1. Create a pull request named **Use outputs**
