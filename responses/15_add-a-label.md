# Trigger all the things ðŸŽ‰

Let's trigger your new workflow!

1. Add a label to this pull request, it can be any label you choose.
1. After adding a label head over to your [Actions tab]({{actionsUrl}}) if you want to watch the workflow.
1. Once your workflow has completed check your [issues tab]({{repoUrl}}/issues) and you should see a new issue with a cat fact as the body!

Continue experimenting with this workflow for as long as you'd like.

Try adding another label and see if you get a new fact!

---

When you have finished experimenting, merge this pull request and meet me [in this issue]({{issueUrl}}) to finish wrapping things up.
