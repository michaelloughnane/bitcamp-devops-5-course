# Hi there ðŸ‘‹!

Hello @{{user.login}}, I'm so excited to teach you how to create your own custom Docker based action ðŸ˜„

GitHub Actions are enabled on your repository by default, but we still have to tell our repository to use them. We do this by creating a workflow file in our repository.

#### What is a workflow file?

A **workflow** file can be thought of as the recipe for automating a task. They house the start-to-finish instructions, in the form of `jobs` and `steps`, for what should happen based on specific triggers.

Your repository can contain multiple **workflow** files that carry out a wide variety of tasks. It is important to consider this when deciding on a name for your **workflow**. The name you choose should reflect the tasks being performed.

_In our case, we will use this one **workflow** file for many things, which leads us to break this convention for teaching purposes._
